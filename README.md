# CREATE A DAPP WEBSİTE 

Bfore we start what we will use source;
<br>
1 - REACT 
<br>
2 - HARDHAT
<br>
3 - İNFURA
<br>
4 - ETHERSCAN
<br>
5 - NODE
<br>
6 - CHAKRA UI
<br>
7 - ALCHEMY
<br>
LET WE START ;)
#
```
- npx create-react-app x
<br>
```

```
- Enter to inside x file
<br>
```
- npm i -D dotenv
<br>
```
```
- npm i -D @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan

<br>
```
- npm i -D hardhat

<br>
```
- npx hardhat
<br>
```
- reate basic simple project
<br>
```
- npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
<br>
```
- get to chakra uı webiste and go to installation - then copy (npm i ....)
<br>
#
we will delete some file in x folder example; satup-test.js,app.test.js vb 
<br>
of course you have to clear ın ındex.js into reportWebtials and course we should delete something in app.js
<br>
find contracts folder then create new file in contracts name 'y.sol' paste your solidity code into y.sol
<br>
enter to scripts folder and create new file name is 'deploying.js' then put your code into deploying.js

we will get fake ether like goerli testnet we can buy from https://goerlifaucet.com/

and of course should from metamask settings show testnets 

go to infura and create new project. choose goerli testnet

come back to vscode add .env file 

enter etherscan key on .env file

enter private keys on .env file

enter hardhat.config.js and put your code inside to hardhat.config.js 

right now we can compile this code 
```
npx hardhat compile
```
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploying.js --network georli 
```


we can go to goerliethercan and we can see contract address 

but there is a little problem  this contract dont verify we will verify this contract

npx hardhat verify -- network goerli ' enter the contract address here '

very good everything is working right now  ;)
