Before we start what we will use source;
<br>
1 - REACT 
<br>
2 - HARDHAT
<br>
3 - İNFURA
<br>
4 - ETHERSCAN
<br>
5 - NODE
<br>
6 - CHAKRA UI
<br>
7 - ALCHEMY
<br>
LET WE START ;)
#
```
- npx create-react-app x
- Enter to inside x file (dont paste this code to terminal)
- npm i -D dotenv
- npm i -D @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
- npm i -D hardhat
- npx hardhat
- reate basic simple project
- npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
```

<br>
- get to chakra uı webiste and go to installation - then copy (npm i ....)
<br>
#
we will delete some file in x folder example; satup-test.js,app.test.js vb 
<br>
of course you have to clear ın ındex.js into reportWebtials and course we should delete something in app.js
<br>
find contracts folder then create new file in contracts name 'y.sol' paste your solidity code into y.sol
<br>
enter to scripts folder and create new file name is 'deploying.js' then put your code into deploying.js
<br>
we will get fake ether like goerli testnet we can buy from https://goerlifaucet.com/
<br>
and of course should from metamask settings show testnets 
<br>
go to infura and create new project. choose goerli testnet
<br>
come back to vscode add .env file 
<br>
enter etherscan key on .env file
<br>
enter private keys on .env file
<br>
enter hardhat.config.js and put your code inside to hardhat.config.js 
<br>

right now we can compile this code 
<br>
```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploying.js --network georli 
```

<br>
we can go to goerliethercan and we can see contract address 
<br>
but there is a little problem  this contract dont verify we will verify this contract
<br>
```
npx hardhat verify -- network goerli ' enter the contract address here '
```
<br>
very good everything is working right now  ;)
